	 should be ran first.
	-Classes as such: Dvd.cpp, Dvd.h, and proj2.cpp, don't have a client.cpp
	 class has called for.
	
	input:
	Once make is completed run the exeucable with the following syntax
	for parameters:
	example <number of clients> <Probability>  <number of transactions> <name of File.txt>
	where:
		<number of clients>      is a positive integer greater than 0
		<Probability> 	         is a positive percentage between 0-1 inclusivly
		<number of transactions> is a positive integer greater than 0
		<name of file.txt>	 is the name of the file typed in
