Program description:
	Program takes in a file that has given routes and stations that builds a network
	of trains routes betweens the stations, and the first stations and routes are put 
	in a route that is defined in the first line. The program is user interactive where the
	user can change some attributes of the system, like adding routes, zones, and stations,
	as well as the status. The user can also find a path within the system once completed,
	with adding routes and stations.

Assumptions:
	input: the given file must be type in that style, and syntax, if not in that 
	format program will do weird things, if file is typed incorrectly the program
	will exit.(See routes.txt) Which the file must be typed has routes.txt or the
	program will give an error statement, the first line in the file is the zone that the
	routes and stations are in.
	
	output: Depending on what the user asks for there are many different commands within the
	the program, such as print(printing zones or stations or routes), and find path.
	Any command typed the program will propmt you the correct questions.
